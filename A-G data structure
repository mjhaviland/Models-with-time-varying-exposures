A fixed covariate has uniquely defined risk
sets at the start of the study, which do not overlap. In
contrast, a time-dependent covariate has changing risk
sets that are redefined, based on the current value of
the covariate, at each unique event time. Hence, the
risk set ni consists of all individuals who are at risk just
prior to time ti and whose covariate value indicates
membership in the group being considered at time ti.
This number can increase or decrease over the time
course covered in the study
